# abbrv-ext

abbrv-ext is a simple Chrome extension that will allow you to alias go/ to your instance abbrv by
rewriting the request mid-flight.

## Installing

Currently, your best route to install the extension is to clone the repo and then load the unpacked
extension. I plan to submit this extension to the Chrome web store at some point, but I need to
convert it to use manifest v3 before I can.
