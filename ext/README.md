# abbrv-ext

abbrv-ext is a simple Chrome extension that will allow you to alias go/ to your instance abbrv by
rewriting the request mid-flight.

## Installing

Currently, your best route to install the extension is to clone the repo, create a config.js (copy
the config.example.js file), and then load the unpacked extension. I may end up reworking this
plugin to be configurable at runtime, allowing the user to configure the abbrv base URL. I could
then publish it to the web store with usefulness to others, too.
